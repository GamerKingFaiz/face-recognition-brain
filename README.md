## Details
Just click "Sign in" to access the face recognition brain. No actual credentials need to be entered yet to access the face recognition brain.

Provide an image URL in the textbot and click "Detect". The API works in the background, detects the faces, and then highlights them on the webpage.

## Geeky Details:
The page is built in React.It's responsive, meaning it will play nice on mobile.<br />
I'm using the [Clarifai Predict API](https://www.clarifai.com/developer/guide) to analyze the image to detect faces.<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
