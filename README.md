Provide an image URL in the textbot and click "Detect". The API works in the background, detects the faces, and then highlights them on the webpage.

## Geeky Details:
The page is built in React. It's responsive, meaning it will play nice on mobile.<br />

I'm using the [Clarifai Predict API](https://www.clarifai.com/developer/guide) to analyze the image to detect faces.<br />

The backend is using Node.js and PostgreSQL for the database. These are hosted on Heroku.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
